INT. - A ROOM
/*^ keyword.other.heading.scene.fountain */

The room is boring and nearly empty.  Also, there's a cat.

GÜNTHER
/*^ entity.name.character.fountain */
Hello.  I'm a cat with unicode characters in my name.

BOLÂO
/*^ entity.name.character.fountain */
My name has unicode in it, too!

JOHN (V.O.)
/*^ entity.name.character.fountain */
My name has none of those fancy characters.

JOHN's name right here shouldn't be a character since there's more text that's not uppercase following it.  This should be fixed now, too.

...but misses. This is not a scene heading, even with the leading period.
/*^ only:(source.fountain meta.paragraph.text) */

STEVE
