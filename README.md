# Fountain Support for Atom
This package aims to provide syntax highlighting and utilities to improve the experience of screenwriting with the [Fountain](http://fountain.io/) syntax.

Features:
* Outline list navigator (ctrl+alt+o)
* Formatted preview (ctrl+alt+M)
* Symbol listing (ctrl+r, via symbols-view package)

## Development
This is currently a work in progress, pulling from a few different tools:

* HTML preview support from [Fountain.js](https://github.com/mattdaly/Fountain.js)
* Syntax highlighting based on [The Candler Blog](http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/09/10/fountain-for-sublime-text/)

Please open issues with feature requests that would improve your work flow.
